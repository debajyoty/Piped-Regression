# Piped-Regression

The proposed technology introduces a novel regression technique based on advanced machine learning con-
cepts. The model takes the dataset as input and generates predictions or estimations based on the input data.
To address the existing limitations of accuracy and robustness in regression analysis, the model employs mul-
tiple regression methods, advanced algorithms, and techniques, making it more reliable and accurate than
current approaches. This paper aims to bridge the research gap in regression analysis by introducing a more
accurate and robust approach for general regression analysis and predictive applications. Although several
regression models such as Linear Regressor, Multiple Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random
Forest Regressor, etc., are available, they have their own limitations in terms of accuracy and robustness. The
proposed approach utilizes multiple regression techniques to enhance the reliability and efficacy of general
regression analysis. The novelty of this study lies in its incorporation of multiple regression methods in the
proposed models, which improves their robustness for both general regression analysis and predictive ap-
plications. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the paper utilizes three datasets, namely
Kaggle House Price dataset, the Boston House Price dataset, and the California Housing dataset. The Kag-
gle House Price dataset has 146024 rows and a target column of SalePrice. The Boston House Price dataset
has 50613 rows and a target column of MEDV. The California Housing dataset has 206409 rows and a target
column of median house value. The accuracy of the proposed models is evaluated using different evaluation
metrics such as RMSE, R2, MSE, MAE, and RMSLE. The results indicate that the proposed models outperform
existing models in terms of accuracy and robustness for all three datasets.
